If you create another page, even when using the same template you won't see that extension. Shared data is a concept that let's you have the same extension on multiple pages just by naming the extension. The best part? All extensions with that name and type stay in sync, so when you make changes to an extension on one page all other instances of that extension are updated. It means you don't have to recreate the same information over and over again on every page you want that extension.\n\n    // ####Deleting Shared Content\n    // However, we need some way of knowing when to delete shared content, say when it's no longer being used? Upon every save, if an extension was removed from the page, we send it's shared content name to the server which will perform a check. If no other pages are using that shared content, it deletes it all together, however if some other page is still using that content, we do nothing.
